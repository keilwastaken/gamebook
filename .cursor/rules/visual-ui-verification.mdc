# Visual UI Verification Workflow

When building, modifying, or fixing a React Native UI component, use this loop:

1. **Observe Before:** Run `./capture-ui.sh pre_edit.png`.
2. **Execute:** Implement the requested UI code changes.
3. **Wait for Fast Refresh:** Wait about 3 seconds for simulator hot reload.
4. **Observe After:** Run `./capture-ui.sh post_edit.png`.
5. **Verify:** Inspect `post_edit.png` against requirements (spacing, shadows, rotation, alignment, tactile feel).
6. **Iterate if needed:** If visuals are off, adjust code and repeat steps 3-5.

Prefer this visual loop over guessing layout outcomes from code alone.
